# AeroTask - Task Manager

This is my pet project built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It allows users to **register**, **add tasks**, and **track their progress**. The application is designed to help users manage their to-do lists, offering functionality to create, edit, and track tasks easily. The main focus is on providing a simple and efficient interface for task management.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register and log in to the application.
- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Task Tracking**: Easily track the status of your tasks (pending, completed).
- **Debounced Inputs**: Uses **just-debounce-id** for input debouncing to improve performance.
- **Unique Task IDs**: Each task has a unique ID generated by **UUID**.
- **State Management**: **RTK (Redux Toolkit)** is used for state management in the app.
- **Simple User Interface**: Clean and minimalistic design for an easy user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for building React applications with server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript for better type safety and developer experience.
- **UUID**: Used for generating unique IDs for tasks.
- **RTK (Redux Toolkit)**: A library for state management.
- **just-debounce-id**: A utility for debouncing input changes, improving performance.
